registry/ is the JSON API for the package registry.

www/ is the code for search.npmjs.org, soon to be www.npmjs.org

# Installing www

You'll need CouchDB version 1.0.0 or higher.  We're using some newish features.
I recommend getting one from http://couchone.com/

Add a vhost config:

    [vhosts]
    search:5984 = /search/_design/app/_rewrite

Where `packages` is the hostname where you'll be running the thing, and
`5984` is the port that CouchDB is running on.  If you're running on port
80, then omit the port altogether.

Now install couchapp:

    sudo npm install couchapp

Now run the sync app.js from this repository.

    couchapp push www/app.js http://localhost:5984/search

You may need to put a username and password in the URL:

    couchapp push www/app.js http://user:pass@localhost:5984/search
